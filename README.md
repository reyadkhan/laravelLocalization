### Simple localization package for laravel

It will switch locale according to **url** parameter or user's language

#### Requirements:
* PHP >= 7.2.5
* Laravel >= 6.0
#### Installation:
* Run composer command:
```
composer require webapp/localization
```
* To publish localization.php config file run the command:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config
```
You can edit the config/localization.php file as your need. The `query_var` is the url parameter. If you want to set locale english then you can pass lang=en as parameter.

`Ex: http://localhost:8000?lang=en`<br>
You can change the query_var. By default it is `lang`.<br>
>It stores user's **locale** in session. So from next request it will take user locale from session. **Session key** is also configured under config file
